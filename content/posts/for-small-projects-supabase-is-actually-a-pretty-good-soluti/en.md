If you stay within the limits or if you don't mind spending money on the cloud —
it really saves time.
Many are currently using Supabase together with [n8n](https://n8n.io/) —
it's a visual tool for automations,
where you assemble logic from blocks:
triggers, requests, actions, integrations.
No code or minimal coding.
You get started in minutes.
A lot works right away.
For prototypes and small services — it's fine.
