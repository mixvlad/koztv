Continuing the story with [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
By the second or third day, I was already starting to think that maybe I should have chosen a different solution.
But every time it felt like: just a little bit more — and it would definitely take off the way it should.
And then there would be happiness.
But it didn't come.
After the fifth day, it got even harder.
It was already a pity to scrap it.
And a lot of things were tied up in it.
And I’d already paid for the server.
And it seemed to be "almost working".
But it still didn't feel right.
At some point, I just set a deadline for myself.
If it doesn't work properly after that, I'm pulling the plug.
No "just one more evening", no "let's try this".
In the end, it didn't take off.
So I scrapped it.
I spent another half a day, probably, migrating everything to a regular database.
And went on to build other features.
I don't know how much longer I would have kept messing around with this trendy solution.
But sometimes, it seems you have to accept that you've already buried a ton of time —
and still let it go to keep moving forward.
Even if it's hard.
Even if it hurts.
