Projects, technologies, attempts to optimize everything,
understand faster, decide more accurately.
Over time, I started noticing,
that perhaps the point
isn't in the amount of work done,
but in the quality of the choices.
This channel is an attempt
to figure out
how we think and choose
in a world that is constantly accelerating.
Sometimes through technology.
Sometimes through chess.
More often — through the pause between decisions.
Without haste, without fuss.
