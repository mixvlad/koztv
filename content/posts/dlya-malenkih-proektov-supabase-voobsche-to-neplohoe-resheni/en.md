If you stay within the limits or if you don't mind paying for the cloud —
it really saves time.
Many are now using Supabase together with [n8n](https://n8n.io/) —
it's a visual automation tool
where you build logic out of blocks:
triggers, requests, actions, integrations.
Without code or with minimal coding.
You get started in minutes.
A lot works right away.
For prototypes and small services — it's perfectly fine.
