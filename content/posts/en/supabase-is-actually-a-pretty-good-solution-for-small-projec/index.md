If you're hitting limits or if you don't mind spending money on the cloud —
it really saves time.
Many people are currently using Supabase together with n8n —
it's a visual tool for automations,
where you build logic out of blocks:
triggers, requests, actions, integrations.
Without code or with minimal tinkering.
You can get started in minutes.
A lot works right out of the box.
For prototypes and small services — it's perfect.
