**If you're going to try it, better install it as a **[VS Code extension](https://app.kilo.ai/welcome)**.**

I tested the terminal installation option, which I always use now and recommend for everything I mentioned above. But not in this case — Kilo Code's terminal interface is really inconvenient:
• there's no "allow all" mode — it kind of exists, but doesn't actually allow everything 😅
• to continue a previous session you really have to struggle
• if you open it in two windows, the second one seems to hijack control from the first instance
Overall, the terminal version looks questionable for now.

But as an extension it looks and works really nicely.
It even praised me for my work, that was nice too.
