If you're hitting quotas or if you don't mind spending money on the cloud —
it really saves time.
Many people are currently using Supabase together with n8n —
it's a visual automation tool where you build logic using blocks:
triggers, queries, actions, integrations.
Without code or with minimal tinkering.
You can get started in minutes.
Many things work right out of the box.
It's perfectly fine for prototypes and small services.
