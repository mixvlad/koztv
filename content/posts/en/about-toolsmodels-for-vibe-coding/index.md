My personal price/quality rating for January 2026.
1. ChatGPT Codex  
https://openai.com/chatgpt
$20 a month, included in the regular Plus subscription, which many people pay anyway.
Very large limits — if you compare it to Claude, it's like their plan for ~$100.
If you don't sit in it all day, but use it for your side projects –
in my opinion, this is currently the best option.
Plus, Codex has a large memory window: it calmly processes large projects and doesn't constantly go into "thoughtfulness" due to overflowing context.
2. Claude Code (Max)  
https://www.anthropic.com/claude
Subscription for $100, but in reality, you often have to take $200 if you work all day or manage several projects. There's no point in taking the $20 one even; it runs out instantly, not even enough for a side project, especially if you turn on the top-tier Opus model.
As a product overall, they are the best right now. They set the direction; the rest are mostly catching up. According to reviews, Opus is considered the smartest model on the market. In my experience — it's not a fact that it's actually smarter than Codex, but if you need to write a lot of code and have an extra $200 — this is probably the best option (although I haven't taken the $200 subscription from ChatGPT, maybe it's better).
3. OpenCode  
https://opencode.ai
Open tool. You can use some models for free, connect GPT or Claude APIs, or even your own local models. Good option if you want to try it for free or use local models.
4. Kimi K2.5  
https://kimi.com
Released literally yesterday. I've already heard good reviews, haven't tried it myself yet. They claim it's at the Opus level, costs much less, and theoretically you can deploy a cut-down version locally (needs a graphics card with a large amount of memory).
5. GLM-4.7  
https://github.com/THUDM/GLM
Chinese model, also aiming for competition with Opus and Codex. I can't say how good it is, but it costs less. And they have a lightweight version GLM-4.7 Flash, which can be used for free via the same OpenCode. Or hook it up to the trendy Clawdbot (Moltbot) — and you don't have to think about tokens/money at all.
6. Google Antigravity  
https://deepmind.google/technologies/alphacode/
Doesn't work in Russia, but you can work around it and connect it via the same OpenCode. I don't know how many free limits it has, but if you want to touch Opus for free at least a little, this is an option.
7. Copilot  
https://github.com/features/copilot
It didn't work out for me. Two approaches: the first time I couldn't pay, the second time — the subscription seemed to go through, but in one project it didn't see it, and in another it constantly hung and threw errors.
Although in terms of price and limits it looks good:
$10 — 300 requests to Claude Sonnet,
$39 — 1500 requests.
But my personal experience was so-so.
If you are just getting into vibecoding – get Codex and don't worry.
For starting now, this is the most normal option.
