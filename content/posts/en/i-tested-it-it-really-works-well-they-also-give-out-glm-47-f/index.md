If you decide to try it out, it's better to install it as a VS Code extension.
I tested the terminal installation version, which I currently always use and recommend for everything listed above. But not in this case; Kilo Code's terminal interface is just inconvenient:
• there is no "allow all" mode; it seems to exist, but it doesn't actually allow everything 😅
• to continue the previous session, you really have to fiddle with it
• if opened in two windows, the second one seems to take control away from the first instance
Overall, it looks doubtful in the terminal for now.
However, as an extension, everything looks and works very well.
He even praised my work, which is also nice.
