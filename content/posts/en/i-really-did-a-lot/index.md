Projects, technologies, attempts to optimize everything,
understand faster, solve more accurately.
Over time, I started noticing,
that the matter, perhaps,
not in the quantity of work done,
but in the quality of the choice.
This channel is an attempt
to figure out,
how we think and choose
in a world that is constantly accelerating.
Sometimes through technology.
Sometimes through chess.
More often — through the pause between decisions.
Without haste, without fuss.
