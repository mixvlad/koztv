Continuing the story with Supabase.
Somewhere around the second or third day, I started thinking that maybe I should have chosen a different solution.
But every time it seemed: just a little bit more — and it will definitely take off as it should.
And then there would be happiness.
But something just wasn't coming.
After the fifth day it became even harder.
It was already a pity to throw it away.
And a lot of things are tied to this.
And I've already paid for the server.
And it seems like "almost working".
But by the feel of it — still not as it should be.
At some point I just set myself a deadline.
If after that it doesn't work normally — I'm done.
Without "one more evening", without "let's try this".
In the end, it didn't work out.
And I threw it away.
I spent probably another half a day to translate everything to a regular database.
And went on to do other features.
I don't know how much longer I would have fiddled with this trendy solution.
But sometimes it seems you need to accept that you've already sunk a lot of time —
and still let it go to move forward.
Even if it's hard.
Even if it's painful.
