Continuing the story with Supabase.
Somewhere around the second or third day, I started thinking maybe I should have chosen a different solution.
But every time it seemed: just a little more — and it will definitely take off as it should.
And then there would be happiness.
But something just wasn't coming.
After the fifth day, it became even harder.
It was already a pity to throw it away.
And a lot of things were tied to it.
And I had already paid for the server.
And it seemed like "almost working."
But by the feel of it — it still wasn't right.
At some point, I just set myself a deadline.
If after that it doesn't work properly — we're done.
Without "another evening," without "let's try this."
In the end, it didn't take off.
And I threw it away.
I spent probably another half a day moving everything to a regular database.
And went on to work on other features.
I don't know how much longer I would have messed around with this trendy solution.
But sometimes it seems you need to accept that you've already sunk a lot of time —
and still let it go to move forward.
Even if it's hard.
Even if it's painful.
