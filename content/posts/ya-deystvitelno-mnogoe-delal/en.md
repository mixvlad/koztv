Projects, technologies, attempts to optimize everything,
understand faster, solve more precisely.
Over time, I began to notice,
that perhaps the point,
is not in the quantity of what is done,
but in the quality of choice.
This channel is an attempt
to figure out,
how we think and choose
in a world that is constantly accelerating.
Sometimes through technology.
Sometimes through chess.
More often — through the pause between decisions.
Without haste, without fuss.
