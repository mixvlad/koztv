Continuing the story about [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
Somewhere around the second or third day, I started thinking that maybe I should have chosen a different solution.
But every time it seemed like: just a little more, and it would definitely work the way it's supposed to.
And then there would be happiness.
But it wasn't coming.
After the fifth day, it got even harder.
I was already reluctant to throw it away.
And a lot of things were already tied to it.
And I had already paid for the server.
And it seemed to "almost work".
But it still didn't feel right.
At some point, I just set a deadline for myself.
If it doesn't work properly after that, I'm pulling the plug.
No "just one more evening", no "let's try this".
In the end, it didn't work out.
So I scrapped it.
I spent probably another half a day moving everything to a regular database.
And went on to build other features.
I don't know how much longer I would have messed around with this trendy solution.
But sometimes, it seems, you have to accept that you've already buried a ton of time —
and still let it go to keep moving forward.
Even if it's hard.
Even if it hurts.
