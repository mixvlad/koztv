I always wanted to use my macbook more effectively and do more tasks then I do right now. And I have found how to make it possible!

You already have this program on your Mac, no need to install something, just type [**Automator**](https://support.apple.com/ru-ru/guide/automator/welcome) in search and use it ðŸ˜‰

So, you can automate some routine tasks on your Mac with this program. Later I will publish some examples how to use it and make you more effective person.
