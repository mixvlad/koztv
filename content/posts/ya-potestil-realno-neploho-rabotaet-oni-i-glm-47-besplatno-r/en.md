**If you decide to try it, it's better to install it as a [VS Code extension](https://app.kilo.ai/welcome).**
I checked the terminal installation option, which I currently always use and recommend for everything mentioned above. But not in this case; Kilo Code's terminal interface is really inconvenient:
• there is no "allow all" mode; it sort of exists, but it doesn't really allow everything 😅
• you really have to struggle to resume a previous session
• if you open it in two windows, the second one seems to hijack control from the first instance
In short, the terminal version looks questionable for now.
However, as an extension, everything looks very nice and works well.
It even praised me for my work, which was also nice.
