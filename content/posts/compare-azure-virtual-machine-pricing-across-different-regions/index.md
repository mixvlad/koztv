Sometimes it doesn’t matter where to place virtual machine, so you just need to find the best price. I prefer to use Microsoft Azure for my projects, so I can place VM in various number of places. Price for the same VM differ across regions and it’s usually a headache to find out what region is the best in performance/price comparison. I have found resource that solved this problem:

[http://azureprice.net/](http://azureprice.net/ "Azure VM price comparison")

There you can easily find out what is the best region for selected type of VM.
