                <p>Continuing the story with <a href="https://supabase.com/">Supabase</a>.
By the second or third day, I was already starting to think that maybe I should have chosen a different solution.
But every time it felt like: just a little bit more — and it would definitely take off the way it should.
And then there would be happiness.
But it didn&#39;t come.
After the fifth day, it got even harder.
It was already a pity to scrap it.
And a lot of things were tied up in it.
And I’d already paid for the server.
And it seemed to be &quot;almost working&quot;.
But it still didn&#39;t feel right.
At some point, I just set a deadline for myself.
If it doesn&#39;t work properly after that, I&#39;m pulling the plug.
No &quot;just one more evening&quot;, no &quot;let&#39;s try this&quot;.
In the end, it didn&#39;t take off.
So I scrapped it.
I spent another half a day, probably, migrating everything to a regular database.
And went on to build other features.
I don&#39;t know how much longer I would have kept messing around with this trendy solution.
But sometimes, it seems you have to accept that you&#39;ve already buried a ton of time —
and still let it go to keep moving forward.
Even if it&#39;s hard.
Even if it hurts.</p>
