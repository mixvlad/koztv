                <p>My personal price/quality rating for January 2026.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>ChatGPT Codex<br><a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt">https://openai.com/chatgpt</a>
$20 a month, included in the regular Plus subscription that many people pay for anyway.
Very large limits — if compared to Claude, it&#39;s like their ~$100 plan.
If you don&#39;t sit in it all working day, but use it for your side projects –
in my opinion, this is currently the best option.
Plus, Codex has a large memory window: it easily digests large projects and doesn&#39;t constantly go into &quot;spacing out&quot; mode due to overflowing context.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Claude Code (Max)<br><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude">https://www.anthropic.com/claude</a>
Subscription is $100, but in reality, you often have to get the $200 one if you really work all day or manage several projects. There&#39;s no point in getting the $20 one; it runs out instantly, it won&#39;t even be enough for a side project, especially if you turn on the top-tier Opus model.
As a product overall, they are the best right now. They set the direction, others mostly catch up. According to reviews, Opus is considered the &quot;smartest&quot; model on the market. In my experience — it&#39;s not a given that it&#39;s actually smarter than Codex, but if you need to write a lot of code and have an extra $200 — this is probably the best option (although I haven&#39;t taken the $200 subscription from ChatGPT, maybe it&#39;s better).</p>
</li>
<li><p>OpenCode<br><a href="https://opencode.ai">https://opencode.ai</a>
An open tool. You can use some models for free, connect GPT or Claude APIs, or even your own local models. A good option if you want to try it completely for free or use local models.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Kimi K2.5<br><a href="https://kimi.com">https://kimi.com</a>
It came out literally yesterday. I&#39;ve already heard good reviews, haven&#39;t tried it myself yet. They claim Opus level, it costs much less, and theoretically, you can deploy a cut-down version locally (requires a graphics card with a large amount of memory).</p>
</li>
<li><p>GLM-4.7<br><a href="https://github.com/THUDM/GLM">https://github.com/THUDM/GLM</a>
A Chinese model, also aiming to compete with Opus and Codex. How good it is — I can&#39;t say, but it costs less. And they have a lighter version, GLM-4.7 Flash, which can be used for free via the same OpenCode. Or hook it up to the trendy Clawdbot (Moltbot) — and not think about tokens/money at all.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Google Antigravity<br><a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/alphacode/">https://deepmind.google/technologies/alphacode/</a>
It doesn&#39;t work in Russia, but you can find a workaround and connect via the same OpenCode. I don&#39;t know how long the free limits last, but if you want to try out Opus for free at least a little, this is an option.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Copilot<br><a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">https://github.com/features/copilot</a>
It didn&#39;t work out for me. Two attempts: the first time I couldn&#39;t pay, the second time — the subscription seemed to go through, but in one project it didn&#39;t see it, and in another it constantly hung and threw errors.
Although in terms of price and limits it looks pretty good:
$10 — 300 requests to Claude Sonnet,
$39 — 1500 requests.
But my personal experience was so-so.</p>

<p><strong>If you are just getting into vibe coding – get Codex and don&#39;t stress.</strong>
For starting out, this is currently the most normal option.</p>
